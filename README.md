# Mod Ideas

This repo is mainly being used as a way for me to save ideas I have had for different possible mods for the Paradox games.

Just because I have a mod idea listed here doesn't mean I will be making a mod for it, just that I began thinking up ideas I think could be good for them.

Feel free to use any of these ideas, as I likely won't even be able to work on them all anyway.

The ideas are separated by game, and then further separated into different folders for each idea, so that if I say, make up example sketchs/pseudocode/etc, its easier for me to separate what goes with what mod idea.
